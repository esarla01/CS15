# Data Structures Projects Repository

This repository contains various data structure implementations and projects built from scratch as part of my coursework and personal development. Each project focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm and demonstrates its use in solving practical problems. The projects span a range of fundamental data structures and their applications.

## Projects

### 1. **Array List Data Structure**
   - **Description**: Implemented a custom array list data structure that supports dynamic resizing, element insertion, deletion, and access by index.
   - **Key Concepts**: Dynamic arrays, resizing, indexing.

### 2. **Linked List Data Structures**
   - **Description**: Created a linked list data structure supporting various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - **Key Concepts**: Singly and doubly linked lists, pointer manipulation, memory management.

### 3. **Binary Search Tree**
   - **Description**: Implemented a binary search tree (BST) with support for inserting, removing, and searching nodes, along with handling duplicate values in a multiset fashion.
   - **Key Concepts**: Binary search trees, recursive algorithms, node manipulation.

### 4. **Green Line Simulator - Priority Queue**
   - **Description**: Developed a priority queue for simulating the operations of the Green Line subway system, allowing efficient access to the highest priority items.
   - **Key Concepts**: Priority queues, heaps, simulation.

### 5. **RPN Calculator - Stacks**
   - **Description**: Built a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using a stack data structure.
   - **Key Concepts**: Stacks, expression evaluation, algorithmic problem-solving.

### 6. **Grep Search - Hash Maps**
   - **Description**: Implemented a search tool similar to the `grep` command that searches through text files using hash maps to optimize the search process.
   - **Key Concepts**: Hash maps, searching algorithms, file processing.
